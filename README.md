# RebalanceAI
RebalanceAI is an intelligent investment assistant designed to make financial analysis simpler, 
smarter, and more transparent. 
It blends quantitative analytics — things like volatility, Sharpe ratio, and returns — with AI
driven market sentiment, helping investors understand not just the numbers, but also the 
narrative behind them. 
Built using LangChain’s agent framework, RebalanceAI coordinates several specialized tools 
that work together seamlessly. It automatically pulls live market data, cleans it, computes 
technical indicators, interprets sentiment trends, evaluates portfolio risk, and finally, suggests 
optimized allocations — all while explaining its reasoning in plain language.
